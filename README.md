## Overview of the Project
### PROJECT : Weather Forecast App

###1. Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a user-friendly weather forecast application that allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any location. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a weather API to fetch real-time data. The goal is to create an interactive and informative app that provides essential weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

###2. Features and Functionalities
Search by Location: Users can search for the weather in any city by entering the city name in a search bar.
Current Weather Display: The app will show the current temperature, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, etc.), humidity, and wind speed.
5-Day Forecast: A section displaying the weather forecast for the next five days, including daily temperatures and conditions.
Responsive Design: The app will be responsive, ensuring it works well on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
API Integration: The application will use a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display real-time weather data.

###3. Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including the search bar, weather display areas, and forecast section.
CSS: Used to style the application, making it visually appealing and ensuring the layout is responsive across different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and handles API requests to retrieve weather data based on user input.


###4. Project Structure
HTML: Defines the basic layout, including the header, search input, current weather display, and forecast section.
CSS: Manages the styling, ensuring a clean and modern user interface with responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for fetching data from the weather API, processing user input, and dynamically updating the weather display.


###5. User Flow
Enter Location: The user types the name of a city in the search bar and clicks the "Search" button (or presses Enter).
Display Current Weather: The app fetches the current weather data for the entered location and displays it, including temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
Update Information: The user can search for a new location, and the app will update the weather information accordingly.


###6. Project Documentation
